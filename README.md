 Steps to using the Stoichiometry Calculator

*Seperate each step by a new line
1. Enter your starting unit. Acceptable inputs are Mass, Volume, Particles, and Moles
2. Enter your ending unit. Acceptable inputs are Mass, Volume, Particles, and Moles
3. Enter your given value that the probelm provides. Ex. If the problem gives 10.0L of H20 then enter 10.0
4. (If chosen Mass as first option) Enter the mass of starting element
5. Enter your starting mole number (The number at the bottom of the mole ratio)
6. Enter your ending mole number (The number at the top of the mole ratio)
7. (If chosen  Mass as second option) Enter mass of ending element
8. Answer along with it's unit appears
